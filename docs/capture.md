Scenario:

LAs have a coverage ratio of 100%. 

Let's say we mint a certain amount of stablecoin 
- Some coll is in Matrix
- We assume LA completely covers that coll
- Take the LUNA data and show how much the IF needs to not get bankrupt

1. Transfer volatility to the LAs
2. If you enter a bearish market, your IF is capitalized enough to keep LAs and the protocol from going bankrupt. 


Fees from LAs go to the IF.
- feature: Add entrance and exits to the simulation so that we can have fees flowing into the IF.

<!-- In our case, we have to model the scenario that someone opens a position to get the funding pay -->
