```python
amt_osmo = 100 # qty of osmo = 100
osmo_price = 10 # price of osmo  = 10
osmo_exposure_0 = amt_osmo * osmo_price # inventory exposure to market for Matrix = 1,000
```

What you want to do is transfer the inventory volatility to the agents (leverage and insurance). Imagine a **one to one mapping, which means the entire exposure is covered by leverage**.

#### Analysis of different scenarios (100% down, 50% down, 25% down, 0% , 25% up, 50% up, 100% up)

- Q: The Matrix protocol has how much collateral from LAs and IAs when the market goes down by 50%?
LA = 0 = 0
IA = 0 = 0

- Q: The Matrix protocol has how much collateral from LAs and IAs when the market goes up by 50%?
LA = 100 = 100
IA = 0 = 0

We need to create `LA` and `IA`. We have to say how much collateral we want to take at what price and see what the number from LAs should be and write it. We want to understand the coverage ratio (CR).  
LA = ?? (qty)  
IA = ?? (qty)

Base case - Collateral ratio of 150%.
CR = 150 % implies LA = 50 and IA = 0.
- If `osmo_price` goes up from \$10 to \$15, the protocol gains \$500 in OSMO exposure.
- If `osmo_price` goes down from \$10 to \$5, the protocol loses \$500 in OSMO exposure since `amt_osmo` is 100. LA = 50 implies that the LAs cover `50 * $10 = $500` of exposure, thus the protocol will liquidate the LAs and take their collateral to remain collateralized. Hence, `LA = 0`.

This is problematic. We won't have many people come to the protocol because the change is too drastic in the event of price decreases for the underlying collateral. A tradeoff of huge gains and huge losses makes providing liquidity as an LA similar to an all-in in poker or a coin toss. 

This is where the derivatives come in. Seasoned traders in financial markets will almost never take a fair coin toss ($\pm100\%$), so we can offer a more reasonable tradeoff risk-reward balance like $\pm20\%$. 

How this can happen is that people pay in funding rate. By paying "the shorts" a certain amount in funding payments, you reduce your potential long payoff while still keeping the potential to make a nice profit. Now, you can take larger "bets" (cover more collateral) without having to worry about losing all of your assets.

Let's say that Matrix follows in the footsteps of Perpetual protocol, where the LAs pay the funding payments in a bull market and be paid funding payments in a bear market.

The LAs p&l in a bull market (price up):
```la_bull_pnl = long_leverage_pnl - funding_payments``` 

In a bear market (price down), 
```la_bear_pnl = funding_payments - long_leverage_pnl``` 

In the bear case, the funding payments offset the losses from the fact that the LAs collateral value is decreasing. 

#### Suppose the funding rate is 60 basis points.

A **basis point** is a term used in finance to refer to an incrememnt of 0.01%, e.g. 5 basis points means 0.05%. If an interest rate increases from 5% to 5.25%, that represents an upward move of 25 basis points.
- You could think of "basis points" as an operator that multiplies the number by `1e-4`.


Let the LA OSMO exposure be \$100M with 24 funding payments per day (hourly). Then, 
```python
la_osmo_exposure = 100e6
funding_rate = 60 * 1e-4
daily_epochs = 24
daily_funding = funding_rate * daily_epochs 
# == 0.144

la_osmo_revenue = la_osmo_exposure * daily_funding 
# == 1.2e7
```

Increasing the number of daily epochs and, thus, funding frequency lessens the impact of the collateral volatility on the protocol. This funding rate piece solves the scaling issue that we would've had for handling, say, \$10 billion in the protocol. Without this short hedge, more collateral in the protocol would mean more impact from volatility on liquidations and PnL. 




# funding rate payment is freq in a bearish regime

# for the short â€”> Insurance fund () + leverage agents pay funding rate
funding_rate_LA = funding_rate = 5E-3
funding_rate_IF = 10 * 1e-4 # this number has to be higher and higher = 1E-3

# all the fees in the protocol outside of the derivatives platform goes to the Insurance fund to set the funding rate

# we solved this assuming 1:1 mapping CV : LA
# CV will be divided between LA and IA (Incentive pendulum based on fees )
