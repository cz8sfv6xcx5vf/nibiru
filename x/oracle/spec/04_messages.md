## MsgAggregateExchangeRatePrevote

`Hash` is a hex string generated by the leading 20 bytes of the SHA256 hash (hex string) of a string of the format `{salt}:({pair},{exchange_rate})|...|({pair},{exchange_rate}):{voter}`, the metadata of the actual `MsgAggregateExchangeRateVote` to follow in the next `VotePeriod`. You can use the `GetAggregateVoteHash()` function to help encode this hash. Note that since in the subsequent `MsgAggregateExchangeRateVote`, the salt will have to be revealed, the salt used must be regenerated for each prevote submission.

```go
// MsgAggregateExchangeRatePrevote - struct for aggregate prevoting on the ExchangeRateVote.
// The purpose of aggregate prevote is to hide vote exchange rates with hash
// which is formatted as hex string in SHA256("{salt}:({pair},{exchange_rate})|...|({pair},{exchange_rate}):{voter}")
type MsgAggregateExchangeRatePrevote struct {
 Hash      AggregateVoteHash 
 Feeder    sdk.AccAddress    
 Validator sdk.ValAddress    
}
```

`Feeder` (`nibi-` address) is used if the validator wishes to delegate oracle vote signing to a separate key (who "feeds" the price in lieu of the operator) to de-risk exposing their validator signing key.

`Validator` is the validator address (`nibivaloper-` address) of the original validator.

## MsgAggregateExchangeRateVote

The `MsgAggregateExchangeRateVote` contains the actual exchange rates vote. The `Salt` parameter must match the salt used to create the prevote, otherwise the voter cannot be rewarded.

```go
// MsgAggregateExchangeRateVote - struct for voting on the exchange rates of pairs.
type MsgAggregateExchangeRateVote struct {
 Salt          string
 ExchangeRates string
 Feeder        sdk.AccAddress 
 Validator     sdk.ValAddress 
}
```

## MsgDelegateFeedConsent

Validators may also elect to delegate voting rights to another key to prevent the block signing key from being kept online. To do so, they must submit a `MsgDelegateFeedConsent`, delegating their oracle voting rights to a `Delegate` that sign `MsgAggregateExchangeRatePrevote` and `MsgAggregateExchangeRateVote` on behalf of the validator.

> Delegate validators will likely require you to deposit some funds (in NIBI) which they can use to pay fees, sent in a separate MsgSend. This agreement is made off-chain and not enforced by the Nibiru protocol.

The `Operator` field contains the operator address of the validator (prefixed `nibivaloper-`). The `Delegate` field is the account address (prefixed `nibi-`) of the delegate account that will be submitting exchange rate related votes and prevotes on behalf of the `Operator`.

```go
// MsgDelegateFeedConsent - struct for delegating oracle voting rights to another address.
type MsgDelegateFeedConsent struct {
 Operator sdk.ValAddress 
 Delegate sdk.AccAddress 
}
```
