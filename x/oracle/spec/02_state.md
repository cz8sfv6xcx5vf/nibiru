# State

## ExchangeRate

An `sdk.Dec` that stores the current exchange rate against a given pair.

You can get the active list of pairs (exchange rates with votes past `VoteThreshold`) with `k.GetActivePairs()`.

- ExchangeRate: `0x03<pair_Bytes> -> amino(sdk.Dec)`

## FeederDelegation

An `sdk.AccAddress` (`nibi-` account) address of `operator`'s delegated price feeder.

- FeederDelegation: `0x04<valAddress_Bytes> -> amino(sdk.AccAddress)`

## MissCounter

An `int64` representing the number of `VotePeriods` that validator `operator` missed during the current `SlashWindow`.

- MissCounter: `0x05<valAddress_Bytes> -> amino(int64)`

## AggregateExchangeRatePrevote

`AggregateExchangeRatePrevote` containing validator voter's aggregated prevote for all pairs for the current `VotePeriod`.

- AggregateExchangeRatePrevote: `0x06<valAddress_Bytes> -> amino(AggregateExchangeRatePrevote)`

```go
// AggregateVoteHash is hash value to hide vote exchange rates
// which is formatted as hex string in SHA256("{salt}:({pair},{exchange_rate})|...|({pair},{exchange_rate}):{voter}")
type AggregateVoteHash []byte

type AggregateExchangeRatePrevote struct {
 Hash        AggregateVoteHash // Vote hex hash to protect centralize data source problem
 Voter       sdk.ValAddress    // Voter val address
 SubmitBlock int64
}
```

## AggregateExchangeRateVote

`AggregateExchangeRateVote` containing validator voter's aggregate vote for all pairs for the current `VotePeriod`.

- AggregateExchangeRateVote: `0x07<valAddress_Bytes> -> amino(AggregateExchangeRateVote)`

```go
type ExchangeRateTuple struct {
 Pair        string  `json:"pair"`
 ExchangeRate sdk.Dec `json:"exchange_rate"`
}

type ExchangeRateTuples []ExchangeRateTuple

type AggregateExchangeRateVote struct {
 ExchangeRateTuples ExchangeRateTuples // ExchangeRates of pairs
 Voter              sdk.ValAddress     // voter val address of validator
}
```
