// Prepaid bad debt will count towards realized bad debt from negative PnL positions
// when those are closed/liquidated.
//
// An example of this happening is when a long position has really high PnL and
// closes their position, realizing their profits.
// There is a counter party short position with really negative PnL, but
// their position hasn't been closed/liquidated yet.
// We must pay the long trader first, which results in funds being taken from the EF.
// when the short position is closed, it also realizes some bad debt but because
// we have already withdrawn from the EF, we don't need to withdraw more from the EF.

can consume the credit we have built before withdrawing more from the ecosystem fund.
